            <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold">1.Discuss the scope of var, let, and const. </h2>
        <br>
        <h3 class="text-lg font-medium"><span class="font-bold underline">Ans:</span>
            In <strong>JavaScript</strong>, variables are used to store and manage data. There are three main keywords in used to declare
            variables in <strong>JavaScript</strong> var, let, and const.
        </h3>
        <h4 class="font-normal text-start px-5">
            <span class="text-lg font-bold">Var:</span>
            The scope of variables declared using the <strong>var</strong> keyword is more extensive,
            encompassing either the entire function or the global context. These declarations undergo a process called
            <strong>"hoisting,"</strong> where they are lifted to the top of their enclosing function or the global scope during the
            compilation phase. This hoisting mechanism can occasionally result in unforeseen outcomes if attempts are made to access the variable prior to its formal declaration within the code. Because <strong>var</strong> does not implement block-level scoping, it has the potential to introduce unintended instances of variable leakage or inadvertent overwrites within the same scope.

        <br>
        <h4 class="font-normal text-start px-5">
            <span class="text-lg font-bold">Let:</span>
            When opting for the <strong>let</strong> keyword to declare a variable, you confine its scope exclusively to the block within which it's declared. Unlike the behavior of <strong>var</strong>, where declarations are hoisted, the declarations made using <strong>let</strong> do not experience hoisting. This distinction results in a <strong>ReferenceError</strong> if any attempts are made to access the variable before its official declaration in the code. The emphasis on block-level scope exhibited by <strong>let</strong> serves as a safeguard against inadvertent variable leakage and contributes to the establishment of a code structure that is characterized by greater predictability.
        </h4>
        <br>
        <h4 class="font-normal text-start px-5">
            <span class="text-lg font-bold">Const:</span>
            Opting for the const keyword when declaring a variable aligns with block-level scoping principles similar to those observed with let. However, const has a distinct purpose - it is exclusively employed for values that are intended to remain fixed following their initial assignment. Once a value is assigned to a const variable, any attempts to alter or reassign that value are prohibited. In terms of scope behavior, const mirrors the rules established by let, providing a consistent approach to variable scoping across the codebase.

        <p><strong>Note:</strong> Understanding scope and behavior differences enhances maintainable, error-resistant <strong>JavaScript</strong> coding.</p>

        <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold mt-6">2.Tell us the use cases of null and undefined.</h2>
        <br>
        <h3 class="text-lg font-medium"><span class="font-bold underline">Ans:</span>
            <strong>null</strong> and <strong>undefined</strong>, two distinct values in <strong>JavaScript</strong>, are frequently employed to symbolize the absence or deficiency of a value.
        </h3>
        <h4 class="font-normal text-start px-5">
            <span class="text-lg font-bold">Null:</span>
            <strong>Null</strong> serves as an intentional assignment value that symbolizes the absence of any object-related value. It finds its purpose in scenarios where a clear intent is to communicate that a variable or property holds no meaningful data. This value is often employed to initiate a variable with a state of vacuity or nonexistence. Additionally, it functions as a mechanism to restore or erase the content of a variable. An illustrative use case involves a situation where a variable is designated to house an object reference, yet there's a desire to express that it presently lacks any reference to an object.
        </h4>
        <br>
        <h4 class="font-normal text-start px-5">
            <span class="text-lg font-bold">Undefined:</span>
             <strong>Undefined </strong> commonly indicates that a variable or property has been declared but lacks an assigned value. It assumes the role of a default value for variables that have not been initialized, function parameters that are omitted, or object properties that haven't been defined. This value frequently acts as a signal of an inadvertent absence of value or an omission in the code. A practical scenario involves situations where you attempt to access a non-existent object property or when a function fails to explicitly return a value.
        </h4>
        <br>
        <p><strong>Note:</strong> Both <strong>null</strong> and <strong>undefined</strong> denote absence of value, with <strong>null</strong> intentional and <strong>undefined</strong> signifying uninitialized variables or properties.</p>
