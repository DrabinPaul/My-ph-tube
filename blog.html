        <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold">1.Discuss the scope of var, let, and const. </h2>
        <br>
        <h3 class="text-lg font-medium"><span class="font-bold underline">Ans:</span>
            In <strong>JavaScript</strong>, variables are used to store and manage data. There are three main keywords
            in used to declare
            variables in <strong>JavaScript</strong> var, let, and const.
        </h3>
        <h4 class="font-medium text-start p-5 bg-gray-200 ">
            <span class="text-lg font-bold">Var:</span>
            The scope of variables declared using the <strong>var</strong> keyword is more extensive,
            encompassing either the entire function or the global context. These declarations undergo a process called
            <strong>"hoisting,"</strong> where they are lifted to the top of their enclosing function or the global
            scope during the
            compilation phase. This hoisting mechanism can occasionally result in unforeseen outcomes if attempts are
            made to access the variable prior to its formal declaration within the code. Because <strong>var</strong>
            does not implement block-level scoping, it has the potential to introduce unintended instances of variable
            leakage or inadvertent overwrites within the same scope.
        </h4>
        <br>
        <h4 class="font-normal text-start p-5 bg-gray-200">
            <span class="text-lg font-bold">Let:</span>
            When opting for the <strong>let</strong> keyword to declare a variable, you confine its scope exclusively to
            the block within which it's declared. Unlike the behavior of <strong>var</strong>, where declarations are
            hoisted, the declarations made using <strong>let</strong> do not experience hoisting. This distinction
            results in a <strong>ReferenceError</strong> if any attempts are made to access the variable before its
            official declaration in the code. The emphasis on block-level scope exhibited by <strong>let</strong> serves
            as a safeguard against inadvertent variable leakage and contributes to the establishment of a code structure
            that is characterized by greater predictability.
        </h4>
        <br>
        <h4 class="font-normal text-start p-5 bg-gray-200">
            <span class="text-lg font-bold">Const:</span>
            Opting for the const keyword when declaring a variable aligns with block-level scoping principles similar to
            those observed with let. However, const has a distinct purpose - it is exclusively employed for values that
            are intended to remain fixed following their initial assignment. Once a value is assigned to a const
            variable, any attempts to alter or reassign that value are prohibited. In terms of scope behavior, const
            mirrors the rules established by let, providing a consistent approach to variable scoping across the
            codebase.
        </h4>
        <br>
        <p><strong>Note:</strong> Understanding scope and behavior differences enhances maintainable, error-resistant
            <strong>JavaScript</strong> coding.

        <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold mt-6 ">2.Tell us the use cases of null and undefined.</h2>
        <br>
        <h3 class="text-lg font-medium"><span class="font-bold underline">Ans:</span>
            <strong>null</strong> and <strong>undefined</strong>, two distinct values in <strong>JavaScript</strong>,
            are frequently employed to symbolize the absence or deficiency of a value.
        </h3>
        <h4 class="font-normal text-start p-5 bg-gray-200">
            <span class="text-lg font-bold">Null:</span>
            <strong>Null</strong> serves as an intentional assignment value that symbolizes the absence of any
            object-related value. It finds its purpose in scenarios where a clear intent is to communicate that a
            variable or property holds no meaningful data. This value is often employed to initiate a variable with a
            state of vacuity or nonexistence. Additionally, it functions as a mechanism to restore or erase the content
            of a variable. An illustrative use case involves a situation where a variable is designated to house an
            object reference, yet there's a desire to express that it presently lacks any reference to an object.
        </h4>
        <br>
        <h4 class="font-normal text-start p-5 bg-gray-200">
            <span class="text-lg font-bold">Undefined:</span>
            <strong>Undefined </strong> commonly indicates that a variable or property has been declared but lacks an
            assigned value. It assumes the role of a default value for variables that have not been initialized,
            function parameters that are omitted, or object properties that haven't been defined. This value frequently
            acts as a signal of an inadvertent absence of value or an omission in the code. A practical scenario
            involves situations where you attempt to access a non-existent object property or when a function fails to
            explicitly return a value.
        </h4>
        <br>
        <p><strong>Note:</strong> Both <strong>null</strong> and <strong>undefined</strong> denote absence of value,
            with <strong>null</strong> intentional and <strong>undefined</strong> signifying uninitialized variables or
            properties.</p>

        <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold mt-6">3.What do you mean by REST API?.</h2>
        <br>
        <h3 class="text-lg font-medium pb-2"><span class="font-bold underline">Ans:</span>
            <strong>REST API</strong>, or <strong>Representational State Transfer Application Programming Interface</strong>, is an architectural style for designing networked applications. It emphasizes simplicity,scalability, and statelessness. It's widely used for building web services and APIs on the internet.
        </h3>

            <span class="text-lg font-bold">Key principles and characteristics of REST APIs include:</span>
            <br>

            <h4 class="font-normal text-start p-5 bg-gray-200">
                <strong>Statelessness:</strong> Every request from a client to the server must enclose all the requisite
            information for
            comprehending and handling the request autonomously. In essence, the server shouldn't lean on any stored
            client state between requests. This trait endows REST APIs with effortless scalability and enhances fault
            tolerance.Client-Server Architecture: The client and server stand as separate entities engaged in
            communication over a stateless protocol, predominantly HTTP. This segregation fosters autonomous development
            and scalability for both client and server components.
            </h4>
            <br>
             <h4 class="font-normal text-start p-5 bg-gray-200">
               <strong>Resource-Based:</strong> Resources constitute the heart of RESTful APIs. These resources are
                identified by URLs (Uniform Resource Locators), and each resource is interacted with and manipulated
                employing standardized HTTP methods (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE) to carry out CRUD (Create, Read, Update,
                Delete) operations.
             </h4>
            <br>
            <h4 class="font-normal text-start p-5 bg-gray-200">
                <strong>Uniform Interface:</strong> REST APIs adhere to a consistent and uniform assortment of restrictions, which include
            standard HTTP methods, status codes, and conventions for resource naming. This streamlines API design and
            facilitates client-side consumption.
            </h4>
            <br>
             <h4 class="font-normal text-start p-5 bg-gray-200">
                <strong>Representation:</strong> Resources have the capacity to possess diverse representations, including
                JSON, XML, or HTML. Clients engage with these representations to access and modify resource data. These
                representations should be self-explanatory, signifying their content type.
             </h4>
            <br>
            <h4 class="font-normal text-start p-5 bg-gray-200">
            <strong>Stateless Communication:</strong> Every client-to-server request must encompass all essential
            information for comprehending and processing that request. This ensures each request's autonomous treatment,
            streamlining load balancing and scalability.
            </h4>
            <br>
           <h4 class="font-normal text-start p-5 bg-gray-200">
            <strong>Layered System:</strong> RESTful APIs can integrate multiple layers, encompassing load balancers,
            caches, and gateways, without clients being cognizant or concerned about them. This partitioning of
            responsibilities enhances scalability and security.
           </h4>
            <br>
            <h4 class="font-normal text-start p-5 bg-gray-200">
            <strong>Stateless Communication:</strong> As a recurring theme, every request from a client to a server
            necessitates the inclusion of all requisite information for comprehending and processing it. This aspect
            further simplifies load balancing and scalability.
            </h4>
            <br>
            <h4 class="font-normal text-start p-5 bg-gray-200">
                <strong>Statelessness:</strong> RESTful APIs, by their very nature, are stateless. This implies that servers
                do not retain any information pertaining to a client's state between requests. This characteristic augments
                reliability, scalability, and overall simplicity.
            </h4>
            <br>
        <strong>In the realm of web services, REST APIs have achieved the status of a standard due to their
            straightforwardness, scalability, and user-friendly nature. They are widely employed in web and mobile
            applications to facilitate communication between clients and servers via HTTP, enabling the retrieval
            and manipulation of data from remote servers.</strong>
